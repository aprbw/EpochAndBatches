# Epoch And Batches

Simple, minimalist, spartan, lightweight, single-class deep learning experiment tracker. Also, library agnostic.

* no installation. Just put the .py file in your project.

* no docs, tutorial, or supports (I got a sample code though...)

* does not automate runs

* does not support distributed computing and what not

* does not even inlcude the codes to analyze between runs

A knock-off of [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) because I cannot get it work.

Check the .ipynb for sample usage.
